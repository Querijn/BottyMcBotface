Whereas, all users agree to it being pull-able in all other official games. While a normal game isn't try-hard like ranked, the user is still probably playing with the goal to win or compete in the game as intended. This may not always be the case in a custom mode.\n\nThe tournament system also takes into account a user's agreement, as the user is choosing to participate in an official game (the tournament system) and therefore giving some consent on data pulling for those specific games by using the tournament API.\n\nThe shining light to this, is that Riot is slowly but surely working towards an external RSO (Riot Sign-On) solution. Meaning, we as developers, can have users authenticate into Riot (officially) via the API. Which if all goes all, means a user could potentially give us their consent to go view their custom game data or champion mastery grades, etc.. but you would probably need consent per user to do these special calls, versus a blanket policy of letting developers go retrieve more private information.",

You can think of Riot as a few dozen internal teams. They each have their own goals and can move their group in a direction that they best see fit for Riot and League of Legends. Obviously, upper management has goals and things in mind, but these groups can strive for those goals in any fashion they like, as they have that freedom.\n\nNow, the API itself is nothing more than an edge layer that exposes the internal APIs. Each endpoint you hit, is the same endpoints (more or less) that the game uses itself, the API ones are exposed to the public. The API endpoints are all managed by different internal teams. One team could control /summoner/ and another the /match/ endpoints. Meaning if the API team wanted to add a new field to all endpoints then every team would have to do this, as the internal teams control their respective API endpoints not the API team itself.\n\nNow on top of this those teams could say \"Well I know you want this but its not a priority for us right now, sorry\". And BOOM, the idea is dead.\n\nSame deal with the RSO, however, rather than adding a simple field they are now exposing private data which on top of not being a priority for some teams, it may also be something certain teams refuse to do, as they think it will be too big of a risk. If Developer Jimmy finds a flaw in the RSO API, they could start pulling actual sensitive and private data, that's a very real and scary thing, because you also use RSO to go view things like your account information and billing, etc.\n\nSo part of the battle is still in defining how they would actually go about this in a safe way, on top of making it an actual priority for every single team that would be involved with it. \n\nTLDR: RSO is a goal, but will take time due to security and priority concerns.",
